"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", a quote often (mis-)attributed to Einstein. Whomever it may belong to, it resonates with myself. During my time in university, I often studied by making summaries as if someone else would use them for studying. This forced me to understand things at a deeper level, because if I simply summarised to review it, I wouldn't have noticed I actually didn't understand why/how/when/... certain things were needed, but needing to be able to explain it forced me to dig into these things.

That's one reason why I'm starting these blogs, explaining and writing things down will force me to have a thorough understanding of whatever I'm writing about. The other reason is that I often struggle with communicating whatever abstract concepts/ideas/thoughts are in my head. Having to write them down will (hopefully) help me learn how to do this properly.
