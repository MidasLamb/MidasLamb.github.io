<div class="blog-content">
    <p>&quot;If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough&quot;, a quote often (mis-)attributed to Einstein. Whomever it may belong to, it resonates with myself. During my time in university, I often studied by making summaries as if someone else would use them for studying. This forced me to understand things at a deeper level, because if I simply summarised to review it, I wouldn't have noticed I actually didn't understand why/how/when/... certain things were needed, but needing to be able to explain it forced me to dig into these things.</p>
<p>That's one reason why I'm starting these blogs, explaining and writing things down will force me to have a thorough understanding of whatever I'm writing about. The other reason is that I often struggle with communicating whatever abstract concepts/ideas/thoughts are in my head. Having to write them down will (hopefully) help me learn how to do this properly.</p>
